# scripts for roblox

I'm an LUA hater, so the only way I'm gonna be motivated to learn LUA is to make scripts with it.
Feel free to copy, skid whatever, it's a learning experience for me!
If you wanna monetize at least send a dm or something so I can give you permission/information

CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE SCRIPT HUB

TODO FOR THE FUTURE
- make my own scripts (i may be cooked)
- learn enough lua to like be good at it idfk (it's a goal)
- maybe emotes? (should be really easy)
